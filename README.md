# Welcome to the open source Contributors portrait! [Live Version](https://mattcrl.github.io/Contributors-portraits/index.html)
------
For the Hacktoberfest, I wanna help beginners having their first PR on a simple HTML/CSS/Bootstrap project.

So the main goal of this repository is to regroup a lot of contributors with their name/nickname, an image of their choice, and a little description of them

-----
## Rules
- Use Bootstrap cards model, you can copy/paste the first model I've done and replace it with your personal information
- No insults/offensive language, PR will be refused and marked as **invalid**
- Play the game with your description/image. I won't accept PR if someone just uses a placeholder and write random work as a description!
- For the image, you can add your file in the **/images** folder, or just add a link of the image of your choice

## I want to do more
Like you see, the project has actually no "style", feel free to enhance it as you wish and share your ideas (don't do ugly things I won't accept it !). Everything must be in the files that are already created (index.html & style.css), and well indented.
It's really easy to do a simple HTML/CSS pull request, so at least indent your code so the project will stay proper :).

## How to contribute
- Fork the project
- Clone it
- Push your job on your repository
- When the job is done, submit a pull request, and that's it!

## More 
Feel free to submit ideas by opening issues, or just by submitting a pull request. For the moment, this project only supports HTML/CSS-Bootstrap to help beginners. But I'll see later if we can add some JS to it if someone has a nice idea :).

### There's a lot of PR and I'm alone to check it so, sorry if it takes some time, I do my best to check them all. If you have an old PR please merge it with the actual version of master to fix conflicts, thanks!
