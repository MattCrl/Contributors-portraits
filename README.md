# Welcome to the open source Contributors portrait ! [Live Version](https://mattcrl.github.io/Contributors-portraits/index.html)
------
For the Hacktoberfest, I wanna help beginners having their first PR on a simple HTML/CSS/Bootstrap project.

So the main goal of this repository is to regroup a lot of contributors with their name/nickname, an image of their choice, and a little description of them

-----
## Rules
- Use Bootstrap cards model, you can copy/paste the first model i've done and replace it with your personnal informations
- No insults / offensive language, PR will be refused and marked as **invalid**
- Play the game with your description / image. I won't accept PR if someone just use a placeholder and write a random work as a description !
- For the image, you can add your file in the **/images** folder, or just add a link of the image of your choice

## I want to do more
Like you see, project has actually no "style", feel free to enhance it as you wish and share your ideas (**don't do ugly things i won't accept it !**). Everything must be in the files that are already created (index.html & style.css), and well indented.
It's really easy to do a simple HTML/CSS pull request, so at least indent your code so the project will stay proper :).

## How to contribute
- Fork the project
- Clone it
- Push your job on your repository
- When the job is done, submit a pull request , and that's it !

## More 
Feel free to submit ideas by opening issues, or just by submitting pull request. For the moment, this project only supports HTML/CSS-Bootstrap to help beginners. But I'll see later if we can add some JS to it if someone has a nice idea :).

### There's a lot of PR and I'm alone to check it so, sorry if it take some time, i do my best to check them all. If you have an old PR please merge it with actual version of master to fix conflicts, thanks !
